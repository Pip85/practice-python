## **project background**<br>

**Part 1:  PyBank**<br>
In this challenge, you are tasked with creating a Python script for analyzing the financial records of your company.<br>
You will give a set of financial data called [budget_data.csv](PyBank/Resources/budget_data.csv).<br>
The dataset is composed of two columns: `Date` and `Profit/Losses`. 
* Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the records to calculate each of the following:

  * The total number of months included in the dataset

  * The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

  * Calculate the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, then find the average of those changes

  * The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

  * The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

* Your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.

**Part 2:  PyPoll**<br>
In this challenge, you are tasked with helping a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process.<br>
You will be give a set of poll data called [election_data.csv](PyPoll/Resources/election_data.csv).<br>
The dataset is composed of three columns: `Voter ID`, `County`, and `Candidate`.<br>
* Your task is to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates each of the following:<br>

  * The total number of votes cast

  * A complete list of candidates who received votes

  * The percentage of votes each candidate won

  * The total number of votes each candidate won

  * The winner of the election based on popular vote.

* Your final script should both print the analysis to the terminal and export a text file with the results.
